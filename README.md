# Auto Mining Token (AMT)

Welcome to the Auto Mining Token repository. This project focuses on integrating blockchain technology to provide token holders with daily BTC benefits in the form of BTCB on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The main branch of this repository is dedicated to the Auto Mining Token smart contract, but this particular branch is specifically for presenting and auditing a new feature, the Loan Protocol.

## Loan Protocol

The Loan Protocol is a groundbreaking addition to the AMT ecosystem, allowing AMT holders to use their tokens as collateral to receive USDT at a predetermined rate. This feature aims to enhance the functionality and utility of AMT, providing holders with more flexibility and options for their assets.

## Project Overview

Auto Mining Token is a smart contract project that automatically distributes a share of daily BTC earnings among AMT holders. The primary focus of our smart contracts is on security, efficiency, and transparent distribution of rewards.
